👨‍💻 **Task:** build a sample form from a given layout.

> Worked with forms to capture data from the web, using a varied range of form elements and exploring its properties.
>
> Learned about validation and further customization of the form templates available in HTML, without compromising accessibility.

💡 **Highlights:**

> Managed to fix a validation error, preventing the browser to apply the styles of `:invalid` pseudo-class in required form elements as soon as the page loads.
>
> Plus, added a `:valid` style to be displayed after correct data entry.
