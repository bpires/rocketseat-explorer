# Rocketseat Explorer coursework projects <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

#### 👨‍🚀 Rafael B. Pires <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

This is a way to document my journey as a WebDev aspirer 🚀

Here you'll find coursework projects and exercises I'm gathering throughout my experience on the Explorer course at Rocketseat, as well as other little projects I do along the way.

If you like this way of documenting your journey, feel free to fork it and use it your own way.

I'd appreciate it if you say thanks [**by ⭐ starring this repo**](https://github.com/bpires/rocketseat-explorer) or sharing your thoughts with me.
